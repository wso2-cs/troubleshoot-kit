## Explanation of the `HTTPSClient` Code

This Java program follows these main steps:

2. **Creates an SSLContext** using the KeyStore and initializes KeyManagers and TrustManagers.
3. **Creates an SSLSocket** to connect securely to a remote server.
4. **Performs an SSL handshake** to establish a secure connection.
5. **Sends an HTTP request** to the server.
6. **Reads the response** from the server and prints it.
